  <p>
    I used to think a resume was enough. You list your skills, your experience, your education — and boom, you're in.  
    But the more I grew in my career, the more I realized something was missing.
  </p>

  <p>
    A resume can say a lot about what you’ve done.  
    But it says almost nothing about who you are.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s when it hit me — I needed something more personal, more dynamic, more *me*.  
    So I built this website. And honestly? You probably should too.
  </p>

  <h2>🧠 A Website Tells Your Story</h2>

  <p>
    Let’s be honest — recruiters and employers are flooded with resumes every day.  
    Most of them look the same. Black text, white paper, the same buzzwords repeated again and again.
  </p>

  <p>
    But a website? That’s different.
  </p>

  <p>
    A website is alive. It shows how you think, what you care about, how you present yourself.  
    It can be simple, or it can be bold. It can be code, design, photos, words — or all of it combined.
  </p>

  <h2>🌍 What My Site Says About Me</h2>

  <ul class="styled-list" style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
    <li>🛠 It shows that I can build something from scratch</li>
    <li>🌍 It reflects my journey — from Syria to Canada, from student to creator</li>
    <li>🧠 It demonstrates not just technical skills, but personality, taste, and intent</li>
    <li>📝 It gives me a space to share ideas, document growth, and connect with others</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You don’t get that from a one-page resume.
  </p>

  <h2>🚀 Why You Should Build One Too</h2>

  <p>
    You don’t need to be a web developer or designer to have a personal site.  
    In fact, the most important thing isn’t how it looks — it’s what it says about you.
  </p>

  <p>
    A personal site gives you:
  </p>

  <ul class="styled-list" style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
    <li>✅ Full control over your brand</li>
    <li>✅ A place to showcase your projects, photography, writing, or anything else you do</li>
    <li>✅ A URL you can put on your resume, LinkedIn, email signature, or business card</li>
    <li>✅ A chance to stand out when everyone else is playing it safe</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    And let’s be real — in a world where everyone is blending in, standing out matters.
  </p>

  <h2>💭 Final Thoughts</h2>

  <p>
    I built this website because I wanted something more human than a PDF.  
    Something that grows with me, something that people could explore, not just skim.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’ve ever felt like a resume isn’t enough — it’s not. You’re more than bullet points.  
    So build something that shows the full picture. A portfolio. A blog. A personal home on the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    You don’t have to be a web expert. Just start. Use a template, learn the basics, or hit me up — I’ll even help if you need.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because your story matters. And it deserves more than just a line on a resume.
