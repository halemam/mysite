      <h1 class="blog-title">🔥 Why I Made This Website (Instead of a Resume)</h1>
      <p class="blog-meta">Posted by Sam Alemam · April 16, 2025</p>

      <p>Let’s be honest — resumes are dead.</p>
      <p>You hand one in, it floats around a few inboxes, maybe gets skimmed (if you’re lucky), and then disappears into some “maybe” folder.  
      Worse? It barely scratches the surface of who you are.</p>

      <p>A list of jobs and skills can’t tell you about the person behind the experience — the grind, the growth, the story.  
      And that’s where this website comes in.</p>

      <p>I built this as a <strong>living resume</strong>.  
      A space that speaks <em>for</em> me when I’m not in the room.  
      It’s clean, real, personal — and yeah, way more interesting than a PDF.</p>

      <p>This site reflects who I am:</p>
      <ul class="styled-list">
        <li>🛠 A creator</li>
        <li>🌍 A traveler</li>
        <li>🧠 A tech mind</li>
        <li>💭 A dreamer with a story worth telling</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Every page, every detail — I’ve built it with purpose.  
      Not just to show what I can do, but to show <strong>who I am</strong>.</p>

      <p>Because when someone visits my website, I want them to <em>feel</em> it — not just scroll through it.</p>
