  <h1 class="blog-title">🔥 Why I Made This Website — and Why You Should Too</h1>
  <p class="blog-meta">Posted by Sam Alemam · April 16, 2025</p>

  <p>Let’s be real — resumes are boring. They tell people what you do, not who you are.</p>

  <p>
    You hand one in, it floats around in someone’s inbox, maybe gets skimmed, maybe doesn’t.  
    And if it does get read? It’s just a list. Jobs. Skills. Education. Buzzwords.  
    It doesn’t show your energy, your creativity, your story.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s why I built this site — and why you should think about making your own too.
  </p>

  <h2>🧠 A Website Is a Living Resume</h2>

  <p>
    I didn’t just want to tell people what I do.  
    I wanted to <em>show</em> them.  
    This site is a space that speaks for me when I’m not in the room. It evolves, it grows — just like I do.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of being limited to one sheet of paper, I get to share:
    <ul class="styled-list">
      <li>⚡ Projects that reflect my actual work</li>
      <li>📸 A visual gallery that captures my journey</li>
      <li>📝 Blogs like this one that show how I think</li>
      <li>🧑‍💻 Design choices that speak louder than “proficient in HTML”</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>🌍 Why You Should Build Yours</h2>

  <p>
    Whether you’re a developer, designer, photographer, or just someone with a story —  
    having a personal website is your own digital home. It’s your voice online. Your style. Your story.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bonus? It makes your resume 10x more powerful.  
    Imagine sending in a job app with a link that says:  
    <em>“Want to know more about me? Visit my site.”</em>  
    It instantly sets you apart.
  </p>

  <h2>🚀 Final Thought</h2>

  <p>
    I made this site because I wanted something more personal than a PDF.  
    If you're reading this, maybe it's time you had one too.  
    Your story deserves to live somewhere — and there's nothing cooler than building that place yourself.
